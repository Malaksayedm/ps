#include <iostream> 
using namespace std;
int main(void)
{
	cout << "Hello, World!\n";
	return 0;
}
// great work 😎 9/10 ⭐


/*@include <"iostream.h"> in c++ the first statement should start with # its a preprocessor directive , inside the <> it should not contain double quotation
 so it should be written like this  #include <iostream> 


int Main(void) when i tried to run with the void it didn't give me any error(idk the reason) so i kept it 
{
	cout >> "Hello, World!/n"  if we just want to print a Hello, World! , so it should be written as it is
		return 0; ( i edited it from return 1 to return 0 as the void don't return anything)
} */
