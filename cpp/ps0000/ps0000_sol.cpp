// Replace @ with # when you include a library
// There's no .h in iostream
// Library can't be between double quotes
#include <iostream>

// main must be written ib small letters not capital
int main(void)
{
    // You must put std:: before cout
    // What comes after std::cout is << not >>
    // Remove /n since it's not wanted and we only want one line
    // Each line of code must end with a semicolon

    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;

    // You must return 0 in main function
    return 0;
}
// great work 😎 9.5/10 ⭐
